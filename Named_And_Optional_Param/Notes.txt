While calling method we need to pass args for all required params but can pass/omit args for optional param

Optional param can be created by passing default value in fn defn

Named param is used to map arg to param name by passing param value along with arg value while calling method - useful if method contains huge no. of params or different data types of params

Using named param, arg can be passed in any order
